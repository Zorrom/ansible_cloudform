Ansible Documenation
Agentless - SSH works fine since its Linux and need to check on the WinRM 
Ansible has encrypted vault for Credentials stroage, can use them across playbooks
Winrm Still has to be configured manually

Variables - Define the authentication once inside the hosts and use them on all playbooks by matching the host groups
Inventory - By default uses /etc/ansible/hosts or else we can use customer inventory for Ansible to understand

Intallin ansible
-----------------
Yum install epel-repo ansible -y

Ansible getting help

Order or precedencse
-------------------------
1) (Group_Vars) All
2) (Group_Vars) Groupname
3) (Host_Vars) Hostname

Ansible order configuration precedence
-----------------------------------------
1. ~/ansible.cfg
2. ~/.ansible.cf
3. etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

Ansible forks are the number of parallel process that Ansible can execute - By default its 5
For production its recommended to have 20 parallen process and then go up or down depending on the system performance
